            <h1 >Volunteers</h1>
            <p className="justify-start">Individuals who willingly devote their time, effort, and skill are known as volunteers.
Depending on the company they volunteer for, these individuals contribute their effort and time to several tasks.
Volunteers collaborate with institutions or non-governmental organizations (NGOs). They usually get trained and work under the supervision of the seniors.
Promotion and raising funds, administrative responsibilities, and team initiatives are all examples of these responsibilities.</p>
<p>crowdfunding platforms can make an enormous difference for the social sector entrepreneurs and their poverty alleviation, healthcare, and other activities on the ground. In fact, it has been proven globally that NGO fundraising gets a huge shot when it is done through crowdfunding platforms.</p>

              <p>The Internet is valuable when extending the reach of your Non-for-Profit Organization. Developing your online presence can share your Nonprofit's mission with those beyond your local community and provide information about your cause.
Building an online presence might sound daunting, at first. And trust me to some extent, it is. Maintaining a blog page will help you accomplish this daunting task. Determine what goal youâ€™d like to accomplish through your blog. Then, develop content accordingly that pushes you along that path.</p>
